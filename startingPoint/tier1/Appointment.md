**Reconnaissance**
The recon phase involves gathering information about the target to identify potential vulnerabilities. In this case, we used the Nmap command `nmap -p- -sV $TARGET` to perform a port scan of the target IP address. The output shows that the host is up and running, with 65534 closed tcp ports (conn-refused). The open ports include port 80, which is commonly used for HTTP traffic.

```

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

**Exploring the website**
At first the web seems quite simple having just a login panel. We then performed a web scan using the command `gobuster dir -u $TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt` to identify potential directories and files on the target system. The command uses the `dirbuster` wordlist to find directory listings. The output shows the results of the web scan, including the URL, method, threads, wordlist, negative status codes, user agent, and timeout.

There aren't any interesting finds.

Since we already have a form we can try to exploit it with a sql injecction, in this case we are going to use a manual one.
We try to enter in the username field the value: `admin'#`Ô∏è

And bingo we get the desired flag.
